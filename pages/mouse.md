# Mouse Head Reference Atlas Framework

Welcome to the Brain Architecture Project's Mouse Head Reference Atlas Framework. This section provides access to all mouse-related resources.

## Reference Atlas

The Mouse Head Reference Atlas Framework provides a standardized approach for mapping and analyzing mouse head anatomy.

### Key Features
- High-resolution 3D atlas
- Standardized coordinate system
- Anatomical landmarks
- Cross-sectional views

[Download Atlas Data](/pages/mouse/datasets)

### Mouse Whole Head Imaging Data
Comprehensive collection of standardized datasets for mouse brain architecture.

#### Categories
- Raw Imaging Data
  - Histology images
  - Radiology images
- Processed Data
  - Segmentation maps
  - Registration results
  - Feature maps
  - Co-registered volumes
