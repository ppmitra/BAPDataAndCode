## Sensitivity and Specificity Calculations on Enhancer based Data

The data is separated into 5 enhancers  (PCBP3, FOXP2_RORB, D2, DA, SST) with two markers each for them. 
The PCBP3 & SST has markers in only one channel, while the others have the markers on two channels. 
We detect the cells marked by enhancers and the antibodies along with the DAPI channel for each image, using morphological operations. 

An example of the enhancer PCBP3 is shown here.
